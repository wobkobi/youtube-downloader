# YouTube Video Downloader

This project provides a simple way to download YouTube videos using a Python script and `yt-dlp`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Double-click `start.bat` to set up the environment and run the downloader script.
3. Enter the video or playlist URL when prompted.

### Important Notes

- **YouTube Rate Limiting**: If you attempt to download the same video too close together, YouTube may temporarily block the request. I'm aware of this issue and will work on a fix.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `yt-dlp`
- Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

The `start.bat` script handles setting up a virtual environment and installing dependencies automatically.
